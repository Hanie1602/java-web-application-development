## Overview
Java Web Application Development involves creating web applications using Java, which is known for its stability, security, and scalability. Key components include **Servlets**, **JSPs (JavaServer Pages)**, and the **MVC2 architecture**.

### Key Components:
- **Servlets:** Java classes that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **JSPs:** Technology for embedding Java code within HTML to generate dynamic content.
- **MVC2:** A software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components.
